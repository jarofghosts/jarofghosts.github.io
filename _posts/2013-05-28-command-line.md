I have a confession to make.

Not too long ago I was doing all my development in Windows.

I know, I know. Terrible idea. And not just because it's unfashionable. It actually requires **so much** extra set up and **so many** workarounds to accomplish anything even approaching a workflow.

Oddly enough, when I first started developing as more than just a passing hobby I did it all from within Linux. Of course, it was also within a graphical environment mostly. I found myself in a terminal about 30% of the time. I developed a healthy appreciation for the command line pretty early, but was still more comfortable doing my tippity-typing in a GUI.

Over time I consolidated hardware and picked up a couple of video games that I enjoyed playing and before I knew it I only had one PC and it was running Windows. It's just easy. I honestly have nothing against it as an Operating System. I'm not one of those people who pretend it's the devil or that people who use it are dumb or something. I really don't care. But it just doesn't work for me.

So in order for me to have a passable workspace I have to install something akin to [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), then [PuTTy](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html), and then download something like [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/server) to install on a Virtual machine. Maybe set up [Samba](http://www.samba.org/) to make the files accesssible from within [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). Skipping some steps including downloading all my packages and etc because it's kind of inevitable. (Also ignoring things like [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) because I'm not well-versed in it.)

That's a lot of effort.

So I went back to my roots. Granted it's not a lot better, but I set up a VPS through [RamNode](http://ramnode.com/) and improved my [vim](http://www.vim.org)-fu. Also began using [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) which is incredible.

Suddenly I feel in control. Suddenly I *want* to work on things. I'm not destroying my concentration by having to move to my mouse all the time. I feel like I am commanding my environment rather than simply interacting with it. It feels great.

I'm not saying it necessarily will work for everyone, but I know for sure it pays to be comfortable in the command line. It also means I can do actual meaningful work on my [Chromebook](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/)
