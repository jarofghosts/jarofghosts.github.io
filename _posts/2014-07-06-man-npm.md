The [npm](https://www.npmjs.org) CLI tool can do a lot of pretty sweet stuff!

In what I predict might be an ongoing series, I want to outline some of the
features that might not get used all that often, likely because they just
aren't widely publicized.

I am going to start with what are some of the more well-known options and work
my way forward. So! First up:

## `npm init`

This is one I can't imagine living without. I doubt there are too many people
out there who *aren't* aware that this is a thing, but there are people born
every day who have never seen the Flintstones, so..

### What it does

Provides an interactive prompt for generating a `package.json` file for your
project.

### Why it's neat

As a rule of thumb, it is best to avoid manual fiddling in your `package.json`.
This gives you a great start in that you don't even have to *create* the file
at all. Plus it automatically fills out sections intelligently like where
your repo lives (if you have a git remote configured).

### Protips

Taking the time to curate your `~/.npmrc` file will allow you to provide
defaults for prompts like license, name, email, etc. Just use the `init.`
namespace for defining these values. You can even go so far as to provide an
entirely different module for generating your `package.json` file.

### More info

## `npm install --save <module>`

This isn't any big secret. It's just an option to pass to what is probably the
mostly widely-used application for npm: installation of dependencies.

### What it does

Updates your `package.json` to include the specified module as a dependency.

### Why it's neat

Another way to avoid opening up your `package.json` file! Plus it adds your
dependency smartly with a version number and the `^` modifier, if applicable.

### Protips

Specify `--save-dev` instead of `--save` to add the dependency to your
`devDependencies`. Specify a version or version range to your install command
to peg it, i.e. `npm install --save through@2.3.4`.

## `npm version (patch|minor|major)`

Now we are getting to the slightly more obscure commands. Judging by the
number of modules on npm that do exactly this, I get the impression not a lot
of people are familiar with it.

### What it does

Bumps the version for your project in the `package.json` accordingly, commits
it, and tags the commit.

### Why it's neat

Takes care of one of the more tedious aspects of maintaining a module.
Does All The Right Things<sup>TM</sup> as far as tagging releases and updating
your repo.

### Protips

Use this. If you aren't familiar with how to know when to bump by which, the
simple rule is:
* `0.x.x` -> [Wild Wild West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6mYGcNgKn8&feature=kp)
* Beyond that:
  + Patch versions are for bugfixes that do *not* alter the API or otherwise
    add or remove functionality
  + Minor versions are for adding features that maintain backwards
    compatibility
  + Major versions are for backwards-breaking changes.

## `npm link`

This is one that comes in handy rather often, that is also rather
under-the-radar as far as I can tell.

### What it does

Creates a symbolic link from a dependency to a local project on your hard
drive

### Why it's neat

No more copying files into sub-project `node_modules` directories or trying
to maintain symlinks on your own. Now you can actively work on a project and
test changes and bugfixes without manually managing the mess of mocked or
copied dependencies.

### Protips

Use `npm link` from within a project to create a global link. Use
`npm link <module-name>` from within another project to symlink the dependency.
Alternatively, use `npm link <project-dir>` from within the consuming project's
directory to link a dependency from another project directory.
